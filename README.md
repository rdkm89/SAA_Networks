# SAA_Networks

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks and data relating to the paper "Inheritance and social networks in three 17th century comedies", presented at Shakespeare Association of America 2019.


## Behn, Brome, Massinger, Middleton

Each of these folders contains all of the data related to that specific play, including the text itself and the generated network metrics.

(NB - the folder 'Behn' contains only the text for The Debauchee, with no additional data. This was included for experimental purposes)


## Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used to create the network edgelists, the ranked metric data, and text-specific metrics such as total word count and total line counts per character.

(NB - the network metrics themselves were generated using Gephi. This will be modified in future work to run in Python, resulting in a full pipeline for scaling the analysis.)
